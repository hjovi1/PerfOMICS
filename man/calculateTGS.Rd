\usage{
calculateTGS()
}
\value{
Returns the total genotype score (TGS) of one polygenic profile.
}
\description{
Purpose: Total genotype score (TGS) reflects the additive effect of genotypes
on predicting a complex trait such as athletic performance. It is an algorithm
introduced by Williams and Folland and is also known as a genetic
predisposition score using synthetic data of 23 genetic markers.

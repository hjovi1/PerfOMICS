Gene,Genotype,Effect on Sports Performance,Training Recommendations
ACE,DD,Reduced endurance capacity / increased muscle performance,"Training to increase anaerobic (a-lactic) performance.Increase progressively but fast the number of training sessions on weekly schedule. If required, emphasis on training to increase endurance. Perform training for strength in high frequency with sub-maximum loads."
ACTN3,XX,Increased slow muscle fiber metabolism- reduced muscle power,Long term physical preparation to achieve technical perfection. Perform many routes of the competition distance / repetitive routes of similar overall distance. Advantage in rapid muscle contraction confers increased risk of muscle in- jury when performing exercises with maximum intensity. Perform exercises in sub maximum intensity or increase progressively the intensity of the exercise.
